# C-C-Programs

An application written in C which displays the calender in standard grid format with functionalities to go back/forward to the previous month/year, custom search a date and print to a file.
For example: for 3rd month of 2015, it displays like this:

Month: 3  year: 2015
sun	mon	tue	wed	thu	fri	sat

1	  2	  3	  4	  5	  6 	7

8	  9	  10	11	12	13	14

15	16	17	18	19	20	21

22	23	24	25	26	27	28

29	30	31

Now if left arrow key is pressed, then it shows result for previous month i.e. for 2nd month of 2015. Simlarly for right key, it shows result for next month.
If up arrow key or down arrow key is pressed, then it shows result for next year or previous year respectively.
Key 'I' can be used for custom search a month and key 'P' can be used to print the currently opened grid into a txt file.
